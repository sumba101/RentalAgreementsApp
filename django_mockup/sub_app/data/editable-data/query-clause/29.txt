Cable TV is provided and service level has been chosen by the owner. No refund of rents shall be given for outages, content, lack of content, or personal preferences with regard to the cable TV service.

I have paid for cable tv as per my service level. There won't be any refund or adjustment if you don't like the content or have different choices.
